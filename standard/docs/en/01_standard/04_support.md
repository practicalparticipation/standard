## Community support

If you are planning to implement or use the OCDS Specification you may find the public-ocds mailing list to be a useful source of support.

You can find details of how to join this list in the [Get Involved](http://standard.open-contracting.org/getinvolved/) section of the OCDS website.

Announcements about proposed updates to the specification, and periods for comment, will be made to the [public-ocds@webfoundation.org](mailto:public-ocds@webfoundation.org) mailing list.
