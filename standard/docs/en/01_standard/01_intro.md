<span class="lead">Governments around the world spend an estimated US $9.5 trillion every single year through contracts. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny. The Open Contracting Partnership is working to change that.</span>

<span class="lead">The Open Contracting Data Standard makes it easy to publish accessible and structured releases of data _and_ documents at each stage of a contracting process.</span>

The specification also describes how to bring these releases together in a contracting record that can be used to find out the current state, and history, of any contract.

This initial version of the specification is designed around describing contracts that result from **procurement processes**. However, the specification is flexible to capture other kinds of contracts, and through specific extensions can be used to describe other kinds of contracts, including contracts related to **land** and **extractives** deals.
