ToDo: General Introduction

## What to include


## How to publish

The Open Contracting Data Standard seeks to balance the diverse needs of data publishers and users, with a general purpose and accessible data model. We recognise that for many publishers, moving towards full OCDS compliance will take time, and may require careful work to update internal data management systems.

Building on Tim Berners-Lee’s [Five Stars of Linked Open Data](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) approach, we encourage publishers to progressively improve their publication, striving to move through the levels of:

**☆ Place data online, in any format**

By ensuring that files about contracts are uploaded to the web.

Proposal: Levels within star levels on what is being published. Star levels reflect usability but not content. How comprehensive is your data at the broad content level?

**☆ ☆ Place data in a machine-readable format**

By using key items from the Open Contracting Data Standard to provide machine-readable meta-data about contracting documents and unique contracting processes. This may be published using flat file formats such as CSV.

**☆ ☆ ☆ ****Use**** a non-proprietary machine-readable ****format**

By using the full Open Contracting Data Schema, and publishing data directly in a structured serialization. This may be provided for bulk export or download in both structured and flattened form.   

**☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ****Use**** ****URIs**** to identify key elements of the data**

By publishing each **release **and **record **at their own own URIs (web address) so that each one can be looked up individually across the web, and using best practices of publishing on the web, fully compliant OCDS data can be delivered. Advanced publishers can provide both human and machine-readable versions of the data at a URI using content negotiation.

**☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ****Make**** ****links**** between your data, and other well-structured data sources**

Make use of URIs (web addresses) inside structured OCDS files to point to identifiers and items in related datasets, such as linking a tender to structured information on the budget that is funding it, or linking contracts to structured public spending data.

We encourage all publishers to strive for at least 2-star publication in the first instance, and to plan to move towards 5-star publication over time.
