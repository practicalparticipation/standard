## User demand and data requirements

<span class="lead">Open contracting data can be used in many different ways: and each users objectives affect the exact fields of data they need access to. We have identified **three priority use-cases** for open contracting data, along with their requirements for published datasets.

All publishers should provide a **common core** of data about their contracting processes, and they should work towards meeting the needs of as wide a range of users as possible through improved publication of further fields. </span>

### Value for money in procurement

Open contracting data can help users seeking to make purchases to get good value for money on the goods and services they procure. Backwards-looking data can also help auditors to assess whether value for money was achieved. 

In many ways, for a contract to have "value for money" we mean that it is implemented competently (in accordance with specifications), in a timely manner (achieving specified milestones by the specified dates), for a competitive price (at or below estimate). Open contracting data could be used to monitor specific procurement processes, or to search past processes for comparisons and insights when planning for a new contract. 

Comparable data using common codelists is particularly important for value for money use cases.

### Detecting fraud and corruption

All stakeholders (civil society, the private sector, government and donors) have an interest in identifying and combating corruption in public contracting. Open contracting data can be used to scrutinize procurement documents and data for ‘red flags’ that might indicate public monies are being mis-used. 

There are two main approaches to fraud and corruption monitoring. A ‘micro’ approach closely scrutinizes individual procurements. A ‘systemic’ approach looks for suspcious patterns, and makes links between datasets to map out networks of funding, ownership and interests. 

Linkable data using globally unique identifiers for companies are particularly important for fraud and corruption detection use cases.

### Competing for public contracts

Open contracting data can be used to track contracting opportunities. It is a core principle of open contracting that information should be made available at the early stages of a contracting process, including clear information on opportunities to tender for public contracts.

Information on past contracts can allow firms to identify likely upcoming opportunities for re-contracting, and can support a more competitive marketplace, as transparency creates a level playing field with information on pricing, contract dates and key deliverables. 

Forward looking and timely information is particularly important for private sector users.
